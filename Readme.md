# Blog App

This is a simple blog application built with Next.js as the frontend and Express.js as the backend, using Prisma ORM for database management. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete blog posts, and it connects to a PostgreSQL database using a third-party service like Neon DB.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your local machine
- A PostgreSQL database connection URL from a service like [Neon DB](https://neon.tech/) or any other PostgreSQL provider

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blog-app.git
cd blog-app

2. Set Up the Database
Create a PostgreSQL database using Neon DB or any other provider.
Copy the connection URL provided by your PostgreSQL provider.
Create a .env file in the root of the backend directory and add the following line:
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_url

3. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend and backend directories and install the necessary dependencies.

For the frontend:
cd frontend
npm install

For the backend:
cd backend (on new terminal)
npm install

4. Run the Application
First, start the frontend:
cd frontend
npm start

Then, in a separate terminal, start the backend:
cd backend
npm start
